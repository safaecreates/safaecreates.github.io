        This short film is a femme coming of age story set in a Muslim diaspora community. Aisha and Khadijah, are ready to explore the world. Naturally, they want to start where they’ve never been allowed & American media has made so enticing. Salma is estranged from the family but the “cool cousin” in Khadija’s eyes who will give them access to this world. As the night progresses, they find themselves unexpectedly exploring their identity in their own culture.        
    <p> No racism, homophobia, transphobia will be tolerated.</p>
    </p>
    <h4><b>CASTING</b></h4>
    <p> AISHA - Arab/Middle Eastern/North African; 18-20 years old (or appears to be so); Khadijah’s best friend; she has a close relationship with her family and Muslim community; she is learning to become her own person and is known for being pointed & judgemental with few words; she has a tendency to worry about reputation, 
        but is also driven to explore the world outside what she knows; she never says no to Khadijah’s adventure plans </p>
    <p>KHADIJAH- Open ethnicity; 18-20 years old (or appears to be so); Aisha’s best friend and Sofia’s cousin; she has a close relationship with her Muslim community and she is the dare-devil of the friend group; she is learning to be her own person and can be clumsy in her social interactions; always scheming an adventure for her and Aisha </p>

    <p> HAWA- Arab/Middle Eastern/North African; 40-55 years old (or appears to be so); Aisha’s mom; she is well-respected within the Muslim community and often worries about reputation; she loves hosting guests and cooking the most elaborate desserts; she is strict with her daughter for the purpose of ensuring her a good future; she is sure about what a good future looks like: higher education and husband and children</p>

    <p>SALMA - Open ethnicity; 20-25 years old (or appears to be so); Khadijah’s estranged cousin; a queer femme who owns her life and everything in it; she yearns to be connected with her community again and thus values her relationship to Khadijah as an “older sister” figure; she takes no shit. *NOTE* This character will engage in minor intimacy on screen when she kisses her girlfriend "hello"</p>


    <h4> <b>DISCLAIMER:</b></h4>
    <p>This story is not made for White Western eyes, it is made for her: a young nerdy North African Muslim girl (me). So as the writer and director, I am not seeking a particular “look” of a person, but rather I want to work with folks who resonate with a femme coming of age story set in a Muslim diaspora community. My particular diaspora community is the Arab/North African one, but I know identities don’t organize into neat boxes. Even if that is not your particular identity let me ask this:

        <p>Do you resonate with developing your own understanding of what is really “haram” and what is not? </p>
        <p>Did you grow up with a notion of a “bad woman”, as told by your elders and community, and struggled with the fascination & horror of wanting to be her and also run away from her? Have you ever thought about where queerness fits into Islam? </p>
        <p>Did you ever come up with an elaborate plan just to wear that short skirt or watch that forbidden film as a teenager? </p>
        <p>Is there some other way entirely that you connect with being a (or ex) Muslim femme?</p>

      <p> 3) in what ways do you resonate with this story? </p>
