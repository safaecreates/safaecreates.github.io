    <h3> Cycle 2 of Being Back in Morocco Home</h3>

    <div class = "paragraph">
    <p>
      One thing I've learned in leaving home and continuing relationships across oceans with family is that sometimes it's an opportunity to create more vulnerability and closeness in ways you can't do physically... so I'm trying to do something like that by sharing some reflections and if you want to read them I appreciate it... if reading moves you to share also I really appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>So looking for a spiritual path or practice has been a side mission of mine ever since I left home. Sometimes it motivated by the need for community rooted in shared values, sometimes by a need to fill the spaces left by no longer engaging in rituals, and mostly by a need that I can't really understand. Sometimes a desperation for deeper meaning to existence, sometimes by an assuredness of a deeper connection to existence. This past year, I connected with a Sufi group based in Toronto that is "queer friendly", I still haven't quite figured out what this means but I do know that womens and mens all share a room in worship, voice, and dress (i.e. no hijabs required). These are not givens in other sufi/islamic spaces. Through these folks I found my way back to a spiritual practice based in muslim prayer and dhikr. Participating in the dhikr always uplifts me and connects me ... prayer not so much and even though it was a turning point for my spiritual practice it's been very challenging to come back to a practice based in Islam. Even harder while I'm back home and experience religious trauma triggers and confusions. </p>

    <p>So far it's been much easier at my mom's house now that I've accepted the dynamics and crowdedness and made my own routine.
Part of the crowdedness is Latifa the housekeeper (yes this is a thing here, we can talk more about it) and her and my mom talking in the kitchen every morning. Sometimes I join them. And Latifa always finds a way to talk about Allah and religion. Part of the reason she gets along with my mom. She is genuinely deeply passionate about her faith. It isn't just a piety competition or show for her. Mostly I admire this part. But she always finds a way to turn our conversations into a lesson about religion and god... and mostly I find this part super annoying.
One morning we talked about the lack of rain and drought that is happening here and she said it was because people had committed so many sins... and I just didn't answer because I don't believe good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.</p>

    <p>But one morning we both surprised each other I think. Usually I don't really make my anti-Islam "controversial" opinions known (it's hard not to be hypervigilant about that here) but this time I told her that I don't think it's good to shame people into being compliant in religion-- "don't do this, do that". And she agreed, she said you should reach a place where you are so deeply convinced of your faith that you will do these things of your own accord.
We agreed that everyone should find their own path to faith... I meant in general and she meant Islamic faith, but I think we were both surprised how much we understood this.</p>

  <p>And in forging my own path is where I'm struggling-- it's not that I don't believe in the direction that I'm going... but around me, it's the insistence on a right path and that anything other is wrong. As I'm writing this I'm realizing the huge difference is purpose. Here, one of the main purposes of a spiritual path is to create and follow a value system. For me, my spiritual practice might be based in Islam, but my value system is not. And I'm not worried about my value system... I'm worried about my spirit, my soul. The purpose for me is hard to describe in words, I wrote a poem a few weeks ago on the anniversary of my grandmother's passing that strung together some words to describe it: </p>

</div>
  <p>when I release structure & desctruction both </p>
  <p>I have found nothingness</p>
  <p>equally I find the longing for what isn't</p>
  <p>a deep longing for an original wholeness</p>
  <p>where you can't even feel the feeling of loss because there is nothing that isn't</p>
  <p>Heavy tears plop down when it makes itself known</p>
  <p>as grandmother جدتي</p>
<p> as love</p>
  <p>as Allah</p>

  <p>But there isn't the familiar sadness associated with loss</p>
  <p>there is a happiness at being aware </p>
  <p>of the wholeness </p>
  <p>I am not currently in </p>
  <p>but was once a part of </p>

  <p>I can only see it's reflection </p>
  <p>I am reminded of it</p>
<p>  I can hear it's echoes bouncing around my reality</p>
  <p>I can't tell if I don't want to look at it, or it's not meant to be looked at</p>
<p>  Either way I want to fill myself with every ray of it's reflection</p>
